        2. NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS: Do not use '*' or '-' for bullet points unless the style guide says otherwise. Use plain text paragraphs.
        3. STYLE MIRRORING: If the Writing Style Guide says the user uses "Hi" instead of "Dear", or "Best" instead of "Sincerely", you MUST follow that exactly.
        4. NATURAL FLOW: Ensure sentences vary in length and sound natural.
        5. ADDRESS FINDINGS: Naturally weave the researched facts into the response.

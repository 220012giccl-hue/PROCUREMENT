- Context: If it mentions a specific product, service, site, or project → is_tender: true
- Known clients (neom.com, aramco.com, etc.) → increase confidence
- SENDER ALERT: Some legitimate business requests come from personal accounts. If the content is professional and asks for a quote, information, or meeting, mark it as actionable.
- CLOUD LINK DETECTION: Recognize sharepoint.com, onedrive.com, drive.google.com, dropbox.com, etc., as sources for project documents.
- NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS: Strictly exclude: CRM trials, automated password resets, generic newsletters, and obvious marketing. These are NOT actionable business emails.

# Project Progress and Multi Agent Architecture Report

## Current Project Status
The project has been successfully transitioned into a dedicated and isolated environment for the second generation of the RFI Agent. This separation ensures that the original system remains stable while we implement the advanced multi agent workflow.

## Completed Tasks
1. Established a new project directory named rfi_vps_version - multi agent.
2. Created a new dedicated database named rfi_multi_agent_dbZ in pgAdmin.
3. Updated the environment configuration file to point exclusively to the new database.
4. Initialized the database schema with the new professional naming conventions.
5. Optimized the database setup script for Windows environments to prevent character encoding errors.
6. Verified that all core tables such as contacts, threads, and attachments are correctly established.
7. SUCCESSFULLY implemented the Multi-Agent Core: ManagerAgent, ResearcherAgent, and WriterAgent.
8. SUCCESSFULLY implemented the AgentOrchestrator to coordinate the collaborative workflow.
9. SUCCESSFULLY integrated the Multi-Agent logic into the main email processing loop.

## Resolved Errors and Technical Hurdles
1. Connection Failure: Resolved database connection issues by finalizing creation in pgAdmin.
- **Action Items & Follow-ups:** Automated stale thread detection with suggested reply drafts. (STABLE)
- **Dual-Mode Intelligence:** Integrated 'RFI Assistant' (Context-Aware) and 'General Assistant' (Global Knowledge) with professional UI switching. (ACTIVE)
2. Encoding Regressions: Fixed emoji-related crashes on Windows by standardizing console text.
3. Database Namespace Conflict: Updated schema to use generic terms (Contacts/Threads).
4. Schema Mismatch: Resolved a 'meta_data' missing column error in the DraftReply model to allow storing multi-agent insights.

## The Multi Agent Implementation Status
The core architecture is now LIVE and functional.

### 1. The Manager Agent (ACTIVE)
This agent is successfully acting as the brain, identifying business segments and providing directives.

### 2. The Researcher Agent (ACTIVE)
This agent is successfully investigating facts from document summaries.

### 3. The Writer Agent (ACTIVE)
This agent is successfully synthesizing facts and strategy into elite drafts. It now supports revision loops based on Audit feedback.

### 4. The Auditor Agent (ACTIVE)
This agent acts as the Quality Controller. It verifies the final draft against the initial strategy and research findings, providing feedback for revision if any flaw is found.

### 5. Deep File Scanning (ACTIVE)
The document classification pipeline now physically extracts raw textual datasets (up to 15,000 characters per file) and feeds it directly into the Researcher Agent, bypassing generic summaries.

### 6. Executive UI Integration (ACTIVE)
Front-end displays have been upgraded to render a high-fidelity "Executive View" on drafts, showcasing the Manager's strategic breakdown and Researcher's verified facts directly to end-users prior to approval.

## Remaining Work and Milestones
- [ ] Integration Testing for Dual-Mode Context Isolation.
- [ ] Final UI Polish for Mode Transitions.
- [ ] Comprehensive Functional Verification.
